# Jumper-Cogs
Python Modules for Discord bot
Developer: Redjumpman

These cogs are developed for Twentysix26's discord bot "Redbot"

Some of these cogs will require that you install a library to use.
Instructions on what and how to install these libraries are located in
each folder's .JSON file.

Some of these cogs may require an API key. Instructions on obtaining
your API key will be detailed in each folder that requires such.

These cogs are tested to have no conflictions with the main branch
of the bot, but is not tested against all other respositories. In
most cases there should not be any conflictions. If one does arise
please bring it to my attention on Github.
