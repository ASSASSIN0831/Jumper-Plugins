# Overview
The plugins in this repo are designed to work only for Red-DiscordBot. Most of these cogs are designed around giving your bot a pseudo-gaming experience to help promote your discord community. Please read over the installation instructions and documenatation for more information on how to use these cogs.

# Installation
First make sure you have [Red Bot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop) installed.

Next add my repo using the following command `[p]repo add JumperCogs https://github.com/Redjumpman/Jumper-Cogs V3`  
[p] will be your prefix.

Next, you will have to download each cog individually. For example, if you want to download Casino, you would enter the following command:

`>cog install JumperCogs casino`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update my cogs. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by typing `[p]cog update casino`.

jonnyli1125 for allowing me to adapt his jisho plugin into the Language Cog.

A special thanks to a few outstanding members of my unofficial test flight: Aikaterna, Claire, and Yukirin.

Also I want to thank everyone in the Red bot community who uses my cogs. Without you guys I would have never continued making these plugins!
