# Installation

####*Cog Install*

cog install Jumper-Cogs "cogname"

*OR*

download the .py file and place it in your cog folder.

####*Dependencies*
Some of my cogs will require you download a library. \n To install a library follow these instructions:
- Open command prompt
- Type pip3 install "Library name"   Example: pip3 install tabulate
- Press enter and let the library load
- Once this has loaded you just need to install the cog!

####*Pokedex cog*

- Tabulate
- BeautifulSoup4

####*Dicetable*

# What's planned?

- League of Legends

- Raid Calendar (With support to sync your own)
- Spotify (Will require you to have your own account)

- I have a lot of ideas and will constantly update this list based on requests!
