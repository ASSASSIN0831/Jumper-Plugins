# Jumper-Cogs
Python Modules for Discord bot

Developer: Redjumpman

####*Pokedex*
- Search for pokemon catch locations
- Search for items
- Retrieve base stats along with their min/max at Lvl. 100
- Pokedex information
- Evolution chains
- Moveset lookup (By generations!)

####*Fortune*
Simple extension that will display a fortune. Can add your own in the file.



# Installation

####*Cog Install*

cog install Jumper-Cogs "cogname"

*OR*

download the .py file and place it in your cog folder.

####*Dependencies*
Pokedex cog will require two library installs. To install these libraries do the 
following:

- Open command prompt
- Type pip3 install tabulate
- Press enter and let the library load
- Type pip3 install beautifulsoup4
- Once this has loaded you just need to install my cog!


# What's planned?

- League of Legends
- WoW Armory
- Raid Calendar (With support to sync your own)
- Spotify (Will require you to have your own account)
- DnD (will include spell lookups, magic item generator, and lore search)
- I have a lot of ideas and will constantly update this list based on requests!

# Suggestions
Have an idea for a cog? Start an issue on this repository and I will try to work on it.
