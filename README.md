# Jumper Cogs

These cogs are designed to work with Red Bot designed by Twentysix26.    
Some cogs will require a library install to work, so please read over my wiki and the info.json file before using.  
Please stay tuned for all the latest stuff from jumper-cogs on my [Dev Tracker](https://github.com/Redjumpman/Jumper-Cogs/issues/2) 

## Installation

To install my cogs add my repo with the following command:  
```cog repo add jumper-cogs https://github.com/Redjumpman/Jumper-Cogs```  
Then check to see if the cog has any library dependencies and peform a pip3 install.  
Please look over the installation section and my wiki for more details on library installations  

## Library Requirements

Review the library requirements in the info.json file within the cog's folder. If you do not have the library downloaded it will prompt you with a message telling you what to do.

To install a library follow these instructions:
```
- Open command prompt
- Type pip3 install "Library name"   Example: pip3 install tabulate
- Press enter and let the library load
- Once this has loaded you just need to install the cog!
```  
For more information please view my wiki page
